Dynlib is meteorological analysis libary developed at University of Bergen. The central repository is here : https://git.app.uib.no/Clemens.Spensberger/dynlib

Documentation for the library is available here : https://folk.uib.no/csp001/dynlib_doc/intro.html

# Dependencies

A list of dependencies to build the library is available here : https://folk.uib.no/csp001/dynlib_doc/pkg.html

Some of the analysis tools are compiled in Fortran, and the python tool `f2py` is used to link the Fortran modules to a python wrapper. Details about `f2py` are available at : https://numpy.org/doc/stable/f2py/

The main Fortran dependencies are:
- LAPACK (https://netlib.org/lapack/) -  libraries to solve linear equations.
- BLAS (https://www.netlib.org/blas/) - libraries for linear algebra.

These two libraries are available on NCI/gadi, see https://opus.nci.org.au/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=248840668

By loading the appropriate modules specified in that link, we can compile the `dynlib` fortran source. 

#  Installation

From a directory on gadi, type

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://git.app.uib.no/Clemens.Spensberger/dynlib.git

You have now downloaded the latest version of the dynlib source files.  

These instructions will install dynlib using a standard NCI python environment, as I had problems linking the fortran modules with python using the CLEX ```analysis3``` conda environment\dots

Let's load the required modules.
